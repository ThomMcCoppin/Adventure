# Adventure

Week 4 - Games

Create a repository called "games" under your own Github account
1. Choose your own adventure

Create a normal HTML file named "adventure.html" with a script tag in the <head>
start with an alert setting up your story
i.e. "You're in a dark room. You see a door with a faint light underneath."
Prompt the user for input by offering them two choices
i.e. "Do you "open" the door or go back to "sleep"?
Save the user's input from the prompt to a variable
Make an if/else if/else statement to handle the 2 scenarios
If they chose open, if they chose sleep, or if they entered something else entirely  
INSIDE of of those blocks of code, prompt the user for input again and save that to a variable
Create another if/else if/else statement to handle this second scenario
This is a "nested" if/else
There's nothing special about nested if/elses except they are inside each other
Use console.log to log messages to users at the end of their path
See attached image for a visual aide
See adventure.html (Links to an external site.) in week 4 repo for example of nest conditionals
